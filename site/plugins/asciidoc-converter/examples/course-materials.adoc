= Computer Science 101: Course Materials

Welcome to the course materials for *Computer Science 101*. This course introduces fundamental concepts in computer science and programming.

== Course Overview

=== Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand basic programming concepts
2. Write simple programs in Python
3. Analyze algorithm complexity
4. Work with data structures

=== Prerequisites

* Basic mathematics knowledge
* No prior programming experience required

== Module 1: Introduction to Programming

=== What is Programming?

Programming is the process of creating _instructions_ for computers to follow. These instructions are written in special languages called *programming languages*.

==== Popular Programming Languages

* Python - Great for beginners
* Java - Widely used in enterprise
* JavaScript - Essential for web development
* C++ - Performance-critical applications

=== Your First Program

Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" program:

[source,python]
----
# This is your first Python program
print("Hello, World!")

# Variables and basic operations
name = "Student"
age = 20
print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
----

TIP: Practice typing this code yourself rather than copying and pasting.

== Module 2: Data Types and Variables

=== Basic Data Types

Python has several built-in data types:

|===
|Type |Description |Example

|int
|Whole numbers
|42, -17, 0

|float
|Decimal numbers
|3.14, -2.5, 0.0

|str
|Text strings
|"Hello", 'World'

|bool
|True/False values
|True, False
|===

=== Working with Variables

Variables are like containers that store data:

[source,python]
----
# Creating variables
student_name = "Alice"
student_age = 19
student_gpa = 3.85
is_enrolled = True

# Using variables
print(f"Student: {student_name}")
print(f"Age: {student_age}")
print(f"GPA: {student_gpa}")
print(f"Enrolled: {is_enrolled}")
----

IMPORTANT: Variable names should be descriptive and follow Python naming conventions.
